# Introduction

"rnp" is a set of OpenPGP (RFC4880) tools that works on Linux, \*BSD and
macOS as a replacement of GnuPG. It is maintained by Ribose after being
forked from NetPGP, itself originally written for NetBSD.

"librnp" is the library used by rnp for all OpenPGP functions, useful
for developers to build against. Thanks to Alistair, it is a "real"
library, not a wrapper like GPGME of GnuPG.

NetPGP was originally written (and still maintained) by Alistair Crooks
of NetBSD.

# Usage

## Generating an RSA Private Key

By default ``rnpkeys  --generate-key`` will generate 2048-bit RSA key.

``` sh
export keydir=/tmp
rnpkeys --generate-key --homedir=${keydir}
```

=>

``` sh
rnpkeys: generated keys in directory ${keydir}/6ed2d908150b82e7
```

In case you're curious, `6ed2d...` is the key fingerprint.

In order to use fully featured key pair generation ``--expert`` flag should be used. With this flag added to  ``rnpkeys --generate-key`` user has a possibility to generate keypair for any supported algorithm and/or key size.

Example:

``` sh
> export keydir=/tmp
> rnpkeys --generate-key --expert --homedir=${keydir}

Please select what kind of key you want:
    (1)  RSA (Encrypt or Sign)
    (19) ECDSA
    (22) EDDSA
> 19

Please select which elliptic curve you want:
    (1) NIST P-256
    (2) NIST P-384
    (3) NIST P-521
> 2

## Listing Keys

``` sh
export keyringdir=${keydir}/MYFINGERPRINT
rnpkeys --list-keys --homedir=${keyringdir}

```

=>

```
1 key found
...
```


## Signing a File


### Signing in binary format

``` sh
rnp --sign --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}
```

=>

Created `${filename}.gpg` which is an OpenPGP message that includes the
message together with the signature as a 'signed message'.

This type of file can be verified by:

* `rnp --verify --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}.gpg`


### Signing in binary detatched format

``` sh
rnp --sign --detach --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}
```

=>

Created `${filename}.sig` which is an OpenPGP message in binary
format, that only contains the signature.

This type of file can be verified by:

* `rnp --verify --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}.sig`


### Signing in Armored (ASCII-Armored) format

``` sh
rnp --sign --armor --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}
```

=>

Created `${filename}.asc` which is an OpenPGP message in ASCII-armored
format, including the message together with the signature as a 'signed
message'.

This type of file can be verified by:

* `rnp --verify --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}.asc`


### Other options

* `--clearsign` option will append a separate PGP Signaure to the end of
  the message (the new output)

* `--detach` option will append a separate PGP Signaure to the end of
  the message (the new output)


## Encrypt


``` sh
rnp --encrypt --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}
```

=>

Creates: `${filename}.gpg`


## Decrypt

``` sh
rnp --decrypt --homedir=${keyringdir} ${filename}.gpg
```

=>

Creates: `${filename}`


# For developers

You may wish to use librnp library in your projects as well.
See the [`src/examples/README.md`](./src/examples/README.md) for the usage details and sample code.


# Install

## Binaries installed

* `rnp`
* `rnpkeys`

## On macOS using Homebrew

``` sh
brew tap riboseinc/rnp
brew install rnp
```

## On RHEL and CentOS via YUM

``` sh
rpm --import https://github.com/riboseinc/yum/raw/master/ribose-packages.pub
curl -L https://github.com/riboseinc/yum/raw/master/ribose.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/ribose.repo
yum install -y rnp
```

## On Debian

``` sh
# Clone the repository by version tag (or omit it to get the latest sources)
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp.git -b v0.11.0
# Enable access to `testing` packages by editing /etc/apt/sources.list
# deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main
# Install required packages
sudo apt install g++-8 cmake libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libjson-c-dev libbotan-2-dev build-essential
# Cmake recommend out-of-source builds
mkdir rnp-build
cd rnp-build
# Cmake it
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on -DBUILD_TESTING=off ../rnp/
make install
```

## Compiling from source

Clone this repo or download a release and expand it.

``` bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on -DBUILD_TESTING=off .
make install
```

# Versioning

rnp follows the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) syntax.

## Checking versions

The '--version' output of the `rnp` commands contains the `git` hash of
the version the binary was built from, which value is generated when
`cmake` ran, consequently a release tarball generated with `make
dist` will contain this hash version.

## Historic

The first version of rnp started at `0.8.0` to indicate its development
completeness (or lack thereof).
