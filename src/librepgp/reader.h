   A reader MUST read at least one byte if it can, and should read up
   to the number asked for. Whether it reads more for efficiency is
   its own decision, but if it is a stacked reader it should never
   read more than the length of the region it operates in (which it
   would have to be given when it is stacked).

   If a read is short because of EOF, then it should return the short
   read (obviously this will be zero on the second attempt, if not the
   first). Because a reader is not obliged to do a full read, only a
   zero return can be taken as an indication of EOF.

   If there is an error, then the callback should be notified, the
   error stacked, and -1 should be returned.

   Note that although length is a size_t, a reader will never be asked
   to read more than INT_MAX in one go.
